    <hr>
    <br>
    <p>Hello! So we come up with the idea of protecting our wildlife by organising campaigns and make you volunteer various programs. As we all know wildlife is precious gift of God to the planet.The term "Wildlife" not only caters to wild animals but also
        takes into account all undomesticated lifeforms including birds, insects, plants, fungi and even microscopic organisms. For maintaining a healthy ecological balance on this earth, animals, plants and marine species are as important as humans.
        Each organism on this earth has a unique place in food chain that helps contribute to the ecosystem in its own special way.
    </p>
    <p>
        Our basic motive includes:
        <ul>
            <li>Hiring voluteers to take care of sick animals</li>
            <li>Afforestation</li>
            <li>Organising Campaigns to spread awareness</li>
        </ul>
